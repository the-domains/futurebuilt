# What I've learned: Don't underestimate people.

## Fundamental change

In what I've learned talking to enterprises with different structures and sizes, most of them are struggling to fully embrace digitalization. It's not a matter of technical difficulty or what to offer in terms of services as an IT organization. It's more about where to start and how to get going on this journey.

## My role as CIO and CPO back in 1998

In 1998 I was appointed to set up a whole new IT structure for a construction company with about 300 people. I knew the company needed a fundamental change. The change was driven by the business. Having data available on a construction site and in the office was key to steering the company. It was a combination of a CFO/CEO-driven request that led us to a whole new centralized infrastructure. I guess it was the early age of a private cloud.

## Skeptical minds turned into fans

Suddenly everybody was able to access data from nearly every device. Back then, that meant in the office and at home from a private PC. Technically, I also made it work with a mobile phone, but the speed was not made to enjoy working with it. [\[AE2\]][0]What have I learned from this experience? Education is key for a project to succeed. Never underestimate the power of a whole crowd of people if you change their lifestyle through technology, even if it's a small change. You need to transform the mindset of people through emotions and improve their quality of lives. Working from home ultimately became a necessary need for employees.

Imagine your digital transformation journey.

Let us build your future. Together.
