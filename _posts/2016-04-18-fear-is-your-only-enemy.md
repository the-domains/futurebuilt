## Teaching life lessons by Disney

[Zootopia][0] was out, the new film by Disney. It features no people, only animals that represent classic stereotypes. The main character, a rabbit, is taught by his parents to behave like one.

One single scene struck me and got me thinking. Juddy tells her parents, "Fear is your only enemy." "Just do it" came to my mind, which is what my sales mentor and coach Dieter Menyhart keeps telling me. My advice to you: Just do as our kids do. Share your ideas, change the world, don't be afraid and believe in yourself.
